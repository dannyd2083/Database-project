# cpsc-304-project

--- This is the CPSC 304 Required Milestone Project. It's the team project, which is constructed by Me (Binming), Danny & Jacob. ---

Our project is trying to create an application for my DataBase intro course through several technology stacks: Java, MySQL.
The application domain is about the social media/ online writing publication (blog) platform's data management. It is designed to perform the function of managing the blog site's data and helping users to easily brand their blog through content. Through the database that we build for storing and tracking kinds of data, user and blog moderators can easily manage the blog sites and perform some basic functions such that publishing posts, change their account's password, getting to know how much influence they get through likes/reposts/comments. In order to do so, customer's information: customer id, name and the pricing-related dependents; blog account's username, password settings, and the posts they published should be modelled. Also, there're so many posts be posts, reposts, getting likes and comments, each posts' data is also pretty important, which must be modelled and managed by our database. 
Since CPSC 304 has taught me how to use the DataBase and the database design, I think the application domain is suitable for a CPSC 304 project.
